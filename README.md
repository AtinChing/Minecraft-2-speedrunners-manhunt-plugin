# Minecraft-2-speedrunners-manhunt-plugin
A remake of the replica of the original Minecraft Manhunt made by Dream, but for 2 speedrunners instead of one.

Commands:

/targets [player1name] [player2name]

This one is for activating the manhunt and passing the two players who will be the speedrunners. You can also use /focusons.

/stoptargets

This one does not take any arguments, it simply stops the manhunt.
